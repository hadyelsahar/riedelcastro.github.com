My name is Sebastian Riedel, and I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the "University of Massachusetts":http://www.umass.edu, working with "Andrew McCallum":http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/ in the "IESL lab":http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/.

In order to improve the world, we need to understand the processes that shape it. Scientists do exactly this, and whenever they advance our understanding, they write down their findings in publications, patents, webpages or the like. However, the sheer amount of text produced, and its ever-increasing nature, makes it impossible for a single person or entity to effectively grasp this knowledge. For example, The overarching goal of my research is to extract and distill this knowledge from natural language text.    
To achieve this goal, I believe progress needs to be made in several areas:

* Natural Language Processing components such as parsers or semantic role labellers
* Efficient Inference in probabilistic models (...)
* Weak supervision techniques
* Probabilistic Programming and Statistical Relational Learning (to scale up development).

Progress in this fields has enabled me to effectively extract knowledge from scientific literature: ...
 


Often this knowledge is already present, 
albeit shattered across 
To do so, scientists observe the world

The main goal of my research is 

My research interests lie in the intersection of 

* **Natural Language Processing**, and in particular Machine Reading/Information Extraction
* Statistical Relational Learning, Probabilistic Programming, and generally the **interface between AI applications and Machine Learning** Technology
* Learning with **minimal supervision**
* **Efficient Inference** in large scale factor graphs
  
See my "publications":/publications/all.html and "software":/software.html for more details.

I am also interested in helping out the "Ishinomaki Children's Refuge Center":http://ishinomakicrc.wordpress.com/.
