title: Sebastian Riedel

My name is Sebastian Riedel, and I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the "University of Massachusetts":http://www.umass.edu, working with "Andrew McCallum":http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/ in the "IESL lab":http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/.

Whenever we advance our understanding of the world, we write down our findings in publications, patents, webpages or the like. This results in a vast and ever-increasing body of literature, impossible for a single entity to effectively access and comprehend. The overarching goal of my research is to extract and distill this knowledge. 

To achieve this goal I have been working in several areas of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning I believe need to be advanced:

* Natural Language Processing components such as parsers or semantic role labellers ("EMNLP06":http://riedelcastro.github.com/publications/details/riedel06incremental.html, "NAACL09a":http://riedelcastro.github.com/publications/details/meza09jointly.html, "ICASSP08":http://riedelcastro.github.com/publications/details/mezaruiz08accurate.html).
* Efficient Inference in probabilistic models ("UAI08":http://riedelcastro.github.com/publications/details/riedel08improving.html, "NAACL10a":http://riedelcastro.github.com/publications/details/riedel10relaxed.html, "NAACL09b":http://riedelcastro.github.com/publications/details/riedel09revisiting.html, "UAI10":http://riedelcastro.github.com/publications/details/riedel10inference.html).
* Weak/distant supervision techniques to learn from existing structured knowledge sources ("ECML10":http://riedelcastro.github.com/publications/details/riedel10modeling.html, "EMNLP10":http://riedelcastro.github.com/publications/details/yao10collective.html, "NAACL10b":http://riedelcastro.github.com/publications/details/singh10constraint.html).
* Joint Inference between traditionally pipelined components ("EMNLP11":http://riedelcastro.github.com/publications/details/riedel11fast.html, "NAACL09a":http://riedelcastro.github.com/publications/details/meza09jointly.html, "ACL09":http://riedelcastro.github.com/publications/details/yoshikawa09jointly.html).

The above research has enabled me develop state-of-the-art systems that consistently rank highest in international competitions on extracting information from biomedical literature: In 2011, and in collaboration with colleagues at Stanford, I developed an event extractor for biomedical text that ranked 1st in three tracks of the "BioNLP 2011 Shared Task":https://sites.google.com/site/bionlpst ("BIONLP11a":http://riedelcastro.github.com/publications/details/riedel11robust.html, "BIONLP11b":http://riedelcastro.github.com/publications/details/riedel11model.html); in 2009 I developed an event extraction system that ranked 1st in the "BioNLP 2009 Shared Task":http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/SharedTask, Track 2 ("BIONLP09":http://riedelcastro.github.com/publications/details/riedel09markov.html); in 2005 my protein-protein interaction extraction model ranked 1st in the "Learning Language in Logic Shared Task":Learning Language in Logic - Genic Interaction Extraction Challenge ("LLL05":http://riedelcastro.github.com/publications/details/riedel05genic.html)

I am also very interested in Probabilistic Programming and Statistical Relational Learning. I think that a major factor that slows down progress in AI is the difficulty of engineering large scale end-to-end systems that reason under uncertainty. Probabilistic Programming frameworks can dramatically simplify this process. To do my part in this I have developed "markov thebeast":http://code.google.com/p/thebeast/, a Markov Logic engine that is currently used in prestigious research institutes around the world and helps developers to create state-of-the-art probabilistic models without the need of a post-graduate degree in Machine Learning. I am also involved in the development of "factorie":http://code.google.com/p/factorie/.

See my "publications":/publications/all.html and "software":/software.html for more details and an exhaustive list of publications.

I am also interested in helping out the "Ishinomaki Children's Refuge Center":http://ishinomakicrc.wordpress.com/.
