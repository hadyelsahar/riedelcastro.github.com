I'm currently a Senior Lecturer[1] at the "University College London":http://www.ucl.ac.uk and an "Allen Distinguished Investigator":http://www.pgafamilyfoundation.org/programs/investigators-fellows/key-initiative/adi-artificial-intelligence-awards, leading the "Machine Reading Lab":http://mr.cs.ucl.ac.uk/. Before that I was a postdoc and research scientist with "Andrew McCallum":http://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/ at "UMass Amherst":http://cs.umass.edu, a researcher at "Tokyo University":http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/ and "DBCLS":http://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/en/ with "Tsujii Junichi":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jun'ichi_Tsujii, and a PhD student with "Ewan Klein":http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ewan/ at the "University of Edinburgh":http://www.ed.ac.uk/home.

I am interested in "teaching machines how to read":http://mr.cs.ucl.ac.uk/ and work in the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. I have an interest in various stages of the NLP pipeline, in particular those that require structured prediction, as well as fully probabilistic archictures of end-to-end reading and reasoning systems. Recently I became interested in news ways to represent textual knowledge using "low-rank embeddings":http://www.riedelcastro.org/publications/details/riedel13relation.html and how to "reason with such representations":http://mr.cs.ucl.ac.uk/publications/details/rocktaschel2015injecting.html.       

I am also very interested in Probabilistic Programming and Statistical Relational Learning. Progress in AI is slowed down by the difficulty of engineering large scale end-to-end systems that reason under uncertainty. Probabilistic Programming frameworks dramatically simplify this task. I have developed "markov thebeast":http://code.google.com/p/thebeast/, a Markov Logic engine used in research institutes around the world. It has helped developers to create state-of-the-art probabilistic models--without the need of a post-graduate degree in Machine Learning. I am also involved in the development of "factorie":http://code.google.com/p/factorie/ and our new framework "wolfe":http://www.wolfe.ml. 

See my "publication":/publications/all.html, "software":/software.html and "scholar":http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AcCtcrsAAAAJ&hl=en pages for more details.

I am also interested in helping out the "Ishinomaki Children's Refuge Center":http://ishinomakicrc.wordpress.com/.
