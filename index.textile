My name is Sebastian Riedel, and I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the "University of Massachusetts":http://www.umass.edu, working with "Andrew McCallum":http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/ in the "IESL lab":http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/.

In order to improve the world, we need to understand the processes that shape it. Scientists of different disciplines do exactly this, and whenever they advance their understanding, they write down their findings in publications, patents, ... [Example]... However, the sheer amount of text produced, and its ever-increasing nature, makes it impossible for a single person or entity to effectively grasp this knowledge. The overarching goal of my research is to extract and distill this knowledge from natural language text.    



Often this knowledge is already present,

My research interests lie in the intersection of 

* **Natural Language Processing**, and in particular Machine Reading/Information Extraction
* Statistical Relational Learning, Probabilistic Programming, and generally the **interface between AI applications and Machine Learning** Technology
* Learning with **minimal supervision**
* **Efficient Inference** in large scale factor graphs
  
See my "publications":/publications/all.html and "software":/software.html for more details.

I am also interested in helping out the "Ishinomaki Children's Refuge Center":http://ishinomakicrc.wordpress.com/.
