I am Sebastian Riedel, and I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the "University of Massachusetts":http://www.umass.edu, working with "Andrew McCallum":http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/ in the "IESL lab":http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/.

My research interests lie in the intersection of 

* **Natural Language Processing**, and in particular Machine Reading/Information Extraction
* Statistical Relational Learning, Probabilistic Programming, and generally the **interface between AI applications and Machine Learning** Technology
* Learning with **minimal supervision**
* **Efficient Inference** in large scale factor graphs
  
See my "publications":/publications/all.html and "software":/software.html for more details.

I am also interested in helping out the "Ishinomaki Children's Refuge Center":http://ishinomakicrc.wordpress.com/.
